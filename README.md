Description:
Another small project using Javascript, html, and css, replicating the famous game T-REX. I've also deploy the game on hostman. You can find it here: https://t-rex-game-replicate.hostman.site/

Table of Contents:
In the file uploaded section you can find all the file you need to play the game! Just download them all in a zip file to make it easier for you to organize. 

Installation:
To install the game, simply install the zip file or download each file separately. Make sure all the files are in the same directory so that they can stay connected when you open the html. After succesfully install all files on your machine, open the html file with your browser to start play! AVOIDE THE CACTUS!!
